# Overall Design Language

- Dark cosmic theme (deep space blacks, blues, purples)

- Subtle starfield / nebula backgrounds (not too flashy)

- Clean typography (Inter / Geist / Space Grotesk style)

- High contrast for readability

- Smooth transitions & hover effects

- Responsive for desktop + tablet + mobile

- Use cards, badges, progress bars, and charts where appropriate

- by default dark theme, also give an option for light theme using toggle button

# Landing Page

- App name: Cosmic Watch

- Hero section with a catchy headline and a call to action button(Continue with Google)

- Features section highlighting the key features of the application

- footer should contain link to github and linkedin and created by team momentum@ 2025

- include beautiful features like quotes and other stuff from your intelligence and also refer to the image and pdf for making the landing page.

- info you can use:
   - Large, bold title:
COSMIC WATCH

Subtitle (one line, very clear):
“Monitor Near-Earth Asteroids. Analyze Risk. Get Alerts Before It’s Too Late.”

Short description (2–3 lines max):
“COSMIC WATCH tracks near-Earth objects using real orbital data and converts it into understandable risk scores based on size, speed, and proximity.”

   - What COSMIC WATCH Does (Features Section)
(
Purpose: Explain the platform’s value in simple, non-technical language

Display 4 feature cards in a grid layout.

Each card should include:

Icon

Title

1–2 line description

Feature Cards:

Real-Time Asteroid Tracking
Fetches live near-Earth object data from trusted space agencies.

Risk Score Intelligence
Each asteroid is assigned a risk score (0–100) based on size, speed, and distance.

Hazard Categorization
Asteroids are grouped into Low, Moderate, High, and Critical risk levels.

Personalized Alerts
Get notified when an asteroid exceeds your custom risk threshold.)

   - How Risk Is Calculated (Explanation Section)

Purpose: Build trust and show engineering depth

Layout:

Split section (text on one side, visuals on the other)

Risk Factors Displayed as Cards or Bars:

Diameter – larger objects cause greater damage

Velocity – faster objects increase impact energy

Miss Distance – closer objects increase threat level

Hazard Classification – official hazard flags increase priority

Include a visual:

Progress bars or radial meters

Example risk score calculation visualization

Add a short disclaimer:
“Risk scores are computed using publicly available orbital data and mathematical models, not predictions of guaranteed impact.”

  - Purpose: Emotional + logical justification

Short paragraph:

“While most asteroids pass safely by Earth, some come dangerously close. COSMIC WATCH turns complex orbital data into actionable insights so researchers, students, and space enthusiasts can understand real cosmic risks.”

Optional visual:

Earth with passing asteroid trajectories

Warning highlight for close approaches
